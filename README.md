1️⃣ Nature of the Assets (Important Notice)

All tokens and NFTs listed above are utility, participation, or expressive digital assets created for entertainment, community interaction, access-based features, and creative expression.

They are not securities, investment products, or financial instruments, and they do not provide:

Ownership or equity in any project

Profit rights, dividends, or revenue sharing

Any expectation of financial return or price appreciation

Participation is entirely voluntary and should not be motivated by financial considerations.

2️⃣ Intellectual Property Ownership

All intellectual property rights associated with the above assets — including but not limited to:

Copyrights

Trademarks

Trade dress

Design rights

Moral rights

remain the exclusive property of Digitalknuckles, unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing.

Ownership of a token or NFT does not transfer ownership of the underlying IP.

3️⃣ License Granted to Holders

Subject to compliance with these terms, holders are granted a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to:

Display the token or NFT for personal, non-commercial use

Use the asset in supported digital environments (e.g., profiles, wallets, galleries, virtual worlds)

Transfer or resell the token or NFT via supported marketplaces

This license is granted solely for participation and enjoyment, not for commercial exploitation.

4️⃣ Prohibited Uses

Unless explicitly authorized in writing by Digitalknuckles, holders may not:

Reproduce, distribute, or commercialize the artwork or branding

Create derivative works using protected IP

Use the assets in advertising, merchandise, or commercial products

Claim authorship, ownership, or endorsement by Digitalknuckles

Use the assets in connection with unlawful, harmful, or misleading activities

5️⃣ Secondary Sales & Creator Royalties

Some NFTs may include creator royalty logic (e.g., ERC-2981):

Royalties are intended to support ongoing creative work and ecosystem maintenance

Royalties are enforced only on marketplaces that honor the applicable royalty standard

Peer-to-peer or non-compliant marketplace transfers may not trigger royalties

Royalties do not:

Create investment expectations

Represent profit participation

Grant holders financial rights

They are a contractual and platform-dependent mechanism, not a guarantee.

6️⃣ Tokens vs. NFTs

Tokens (e.g., GMC, FARTS, SPW, etc.) are participation and access tools, not financial assets

NFTs are digital collectibles intended for engagement and expression

Neither tokens nor NFTs are designed, marketed, or intended as investments

7️⃣ First Sale Doctrine (Clarification)

To the extent applicable under local law:

Holders may resell or transfer the specific token or NFT they own

The First Sale Doctrine applies only to the token/NFT as a copy, not to the underlying intellectual property

No reproduction, commercial use, or IP exploitation rights are granted beyond this license

Smart-contract royalties and marketplace terms operate as separate contractual layers, not as restrictions on lawful transfer.

8️⃣ Termination of License

Any violation of these terms will result in automatic termination of the license granted herein. Ownership of the token or NFT may persist, but all usage rights immediately cease upon violation.

9️⃣ Disclaimer of Financial Intent All assets covered by these terms are offered solely for entertainment, creative participation, and access-based experiences.

There is:

No promise of future value

No reliance on managerial efforts for profit

No financial performance representation

Users should interact only if they understand and accept the non-financial nature of these assets.

✔️ Summary (Plain English)

Digitalknuckles keeps all IP

You can own, display, and resell tokens/NFTs

You cannot commercialize or copy the artwork

Royalties are creator support, not profit sharing

Nothing here is an investment

No statements, designs, or technical features of these assets should be interpreted as creating a reasonable expectation of profit under U.S. securities law or as a crypto-asset investment under EU MiCA.
